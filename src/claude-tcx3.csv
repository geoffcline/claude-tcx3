batch-supported-iam-actions-resources.md,Supported resource\-level permissions for AWS Batch API actions,63,Learn how to control access to AWS Batch resources and actions with resource-level permissions based on conditions and specific resources.,Controlling Access to AWS Batch Resources with Resource-Level Permissions,73,"The term *resource\-level permissions* refers to the ability to specify the resources that users are allowed to perform actions on\. AWS Batch has partial support for resource\-level permissions\. For some AWS Batch actions, you can control when users are allowed to use those actions based on conditions that must be met\. You can also control based on the specific resources that users are allowed to use\. For example, you can grant users permissions to submit jobs, but only to a specific job queue and only with a specific job definition\."
multi-container-jobs-scenarios.md,AWS Batch job scenarios using EcsProperties,43,"Learn how to create multi-container AWS Batch job definitions for Amazon ECS on Amazon EC2, Fargate, and Amazon EKS, and multi-node parallel jobs with examples.",Create Multi-Container AWS Batch Job Definitions for ECS,56,"To illustrate how AWS Batch job definitions that use `EcsProperties` can be structured based on your needs, this topic presents the following [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterJobDefinition.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterJobDefinition.html) payloads\. You can copy these examples into a file, customize them to your needs, and then use the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) to call `RegisterJobDefinition`\."
allocation-strategies.md,Allocation strategies,21,Learn how to use allocation strategies in AWS Batch to manage On-Demand and Spot Instance capacity across multiple instance types for efficient job execution and cost optimization.,Optimizing Instance Capacity with AWS Batch Allocation Strategies,65,"When a managed compute environment is created, AWS Batch selects instance types from the `[instanceTypes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_ComputeResource.html#Batch-Type-ComputeResource-instanceTypes)` specified that best fit the needs of the jobs\. The allocation strategy defines behavior when AWS Batch needs additional capacity\. This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that run on Fargate resources\. Don't specify this parameter\."
create-public-private-vpc.md,Creating a virtual private cloud,32,"Learn how to create a virtual private cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets to run AWS Batch compute resources in isolation, securing network access for jobs while enabling communication with AWS services.",Configure Secure Network Isolation with Virtual Private Cloud,61,"Compute resources in your compute environments need external network access to communicate with AWS Batch and Amazon ECS service endpoints\. However, you might have jobs that you want to run in private subnets\. To have the flexibility to run jobs in either a public or private subnet, create a VPC that has both public and private subnets\."
what-is-batch.md,What Is AWS Batch?,18,"Learn how to run batch computing workloads efficiently on the AWS Cloud using AWS Batch, a fully managed service that provisions compute resources and optimizes workload distribution.",Running Batch Computing Workloads on AWS with Batch Service,59,"AWS Batch helps you to run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud\. Batch computing is a common way for developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources\. AWS Batch removes the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing the required infrastructure, similar to traditional batch computing software\. This service can efficiently provision resources in response to jobs submitted in order to eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver results quickly\."
memory-cpu-batch-eks.md,Memory and vCPU considerations for AWS Batch on Amazon EKS,58,"Discover how to specify vCPU and memory resources for AWS Batch on Amazon EKS, along with constraints and examples for optimal resource allocation and scaling.",Specifying vCPU and Memory Resources for AWS Batch on Amazon EKS,64,"In AWS Batch on Amazon EKS, you can specify the resources that are made available to a container\. For example, you can specify `requests` or `limits` values for vCPU and memory resources\."
fargate.md,AWS Batch on AWS Fargate,24,Learn how to run containerized jobs using AWS Batch on AWS Fargate without managing servers or EC2 instances to simplify container orchestration.,Running Containerized Batch Jobs with AWS Fargate,49,"AWS Fargate is a technology that you can use with AWS Batch to run [containers](https://aws.amazon.com/what-are-containers) without having to manage servers or clusters of Amazon EC2 instances\. With AWS Fargate, you no longer have to provision, configure, or scale clusters of virtual machines to run containers\. This removes the need to choose server types, decide when to scale your clusters, or optimize cluster packing\."
example-job-definitions.md,Example job definitions,23,"Discover examples of AWS Batch job definitions covering environment variables, parameter substitution, GPU testing, and multi-node parallel jobs for improved workload management.",Sample Job Definitions for AWS Batch Workloads,46,"The following example job definitions illustrate how to use common patterns such as environment variables, parameter substitution, and volume mounts\."
batch-cwe-target.md,AWS Batch jobs as EventBridge targets,37,"Discover how EventBridge targets work with AWS Batch to submit jobs on schedules or in response to events, leveraging cron expressions, event patterns, and input transformers.",Triggering AWS Batch Jobs with Amazon EventBridge,49,"Amazon EventBridge delivers a near real\-time stream of system events that describe changes in Amazon Web Services resources\. Typically, AWS Batch on Amazon Elastic Container Service, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, and AWS Fargate jobs are available as EventBridge targets\. Using simple rules, you can match events and submit AWS Batch jobs in response to them\. For more information, see [What is EventBridge?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-what-is.html) in the *Amazon EventBridge User Guide*\."
getting-started-eks.md,Getting started with AWS Batch on Amazon EKS,44,Learn how to set up and use AWS Batch on Amazon EKS to schedule and scale batch workloads within existing Amazon EKS clusters.,Running Batch Workloads on Amazon EKS,37,"AWS Batch on Amazon EKS is a managed service for scheduling and scaling batch workloads into existing Amazon EKS clusters\. AWS Batch doesn't create, administer, or perform lifecycle operations of your Amazon EKS clusters on your behalf\. AWS Batch orchestration scales up and down nodes managed by AWS Batch and run pods on those nodes\."
